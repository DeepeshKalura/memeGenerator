## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (the project was developed using Flutter 2.5.0 and Dart 2.14.0).
- A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-meme-generator.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd random-meme-generator
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Flutter's package manager:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the application on an emulator or physical device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to fetch and view random memes. Here's how it works:

1. Open the app, and you will see a button labeled "Generate Random Meme."

2. Tap the button, and the application will make an HTTP request to a meme API (you can specify the API endpoint in the code).

3. The API will respond with a JSON object containing information about a random meme, including its title, image URL, and perhaps other details.

4. The app will display the meme's title and image, allowing users to enjoy a good laugh.

5. You can tap the "Generate Random Meme" button again to load another random meme.
